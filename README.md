# ENGR122_Project
# The goal of this project is to implement a maze creation and maze solving algorithm into MATLAB. It will to generate and plot a maze and the program will then implement a selected algorithm to solve the maze and observe the relative efficiency and passages used. It will be able to demonstrate a single point solving algorithm as if the maze must be solved by a robot or human
